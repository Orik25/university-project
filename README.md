This mobile application is developed to help students keep track of their class schedule. It 
included the user's personal profile, which tracked the individual schedule, 
announcements taken from the university's website, funny quotes from teachers 
published in the Telegram channel, the schedule itself, tracking the occupancy of 
classrooms, and contact information about the university and faculties.
